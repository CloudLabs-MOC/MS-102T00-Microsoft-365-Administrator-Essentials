# Learning Path 1 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Initialize your Microsoft 365 Tenant 

## Lab scenario

Adatum Corporation is a subsidiary of Contoso Electronics. Adatum runs its legacy applications (such as Microsoft Exchange Server 2019) in an on-premises deployment. However, it recently subscribed to Microsoft 365, thereby creating a hybrid deployment in which it must synchronize its on-premises and cloud deployments. 

As Adatum's Microsoft 365 administrator, you have been tasked with deploying Microsoft 365 in Adatum’s hybrid deployment using a virtualized lab environment. In this exercise, you will set up Adatum's Microsoft 365 trial tenant.

In your lab environment, your lab hosting provider has already obtained a Microsoft 365 trial tenant for you. 

You are logged into the LON-CL1. When you access Microsoft 365 for the first time, you will initially log in using the Microsoft 365 tenant admin account (ODL user). You will then update Adatum's Microsoft 365 organizational profile, and you'll prepare your tenant for Microsoft Entra ID and for later labs using Information Rights Management, audit alerts, Microsoft Graph PowerShell.
 
### Task 0- Pre-requisite

1. When you open your lab hosting provider's Virtual Machine environment, you need to begin with the LON-CL1. If your VM environment opens with one of the other machines (such as LON-DC1), then switch to LON-CL1 now.

    >**Important**: LON-CL1 is the Lab-VM itself.

1. Back on the **Organization profile** tab, in the list of organization profile data, select **Release preferences**.

    >**Note:** One of the benefits of Microsoft 365 is its ability to have the latest features and updates automatically applied to your environment. This process can reduce maintenance costs and overhead for an organization and allow early-adopter users to test new features. By setting up your **Release preferences**, you can control how and when your Microsoft 365 tenant receives these updates.

    ![](../Images/release.png)

1. In the **Release preferences** pane that appears, select the **Targeted release for select users** option and then select **Save**.

	>**Note:** the **Targeted release for select users** option enables you to create a control group of users who will preview updates so that you can prepare the updates for your entire organization. The **Targeted release for everyone** option is more commonly used in development environments, where you can get updates early for your entire organization. In non-development environments, such as Adatum, targeted release to a select group of users is a more typical preference as it enables an organization to control when it wants to make updates available to everyone once they've been reviewed by the control group.

	![](../Images/MS-102-image-4.png)

1. In the **Release preferences** pane, below the list of release options, select the **Select users** option.

1. Remain logged into **LON-CL1** with Microsoft Edge open to the **Microsoft 365 admin center** for the next task.

### Task 3 - Enable Information Rights Management for SharePoint Online  

>**Important:** While you will validate IRM for Exchange and SharePoint in Lab 7, you must enable IRM for SharePoint Online now because it can take up to 60 minutes or more for IRM to show up in SharePoint Online. By the time you get to the validation exercise in Lab 7, IRM should have finished its internal configuration and you won’t have to wait for it to be present in SharePoint Online. Keep this time issue in mind if you plan to enable IRM in your real-world deployment. 

1. In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, select **Show all** in the left-hand navigation pane to see all the navigation options. Under the **Admin centers** group, select **SharePoint**. This will open the **SharePoint admin center** in a new tab.

1. In the **Welcome to your new home page** window, select **Take the tour**.

1. In the **SharePoint admin center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Settings**. 

1. At the bottom of the **Settings** page is a sentence that says **Can’t find the setting you’re looking for? Go to the classic settings page.** In this sentence, select the hyperlinked text that says: **classic settings page**.

    ![](../Images/settingspage.png)

1. On the classic **Settings** page, scroll down to the **Information Rights Management (IRM)** section. In the options to the right of this section, select the **Use the IRM service specified in your configuration (1)** option, and then select the **Refresh IRM Settings (2)** button.

    ![](../Images/usetheirm.png)

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the **OK** button. 

1. Once the changes have been saved, you will be returned to the top of the **Settings** page. In your browser, close the current tab that you're on. This will return you to the **Settings** page in the **SharePoint admin center**.

1. Close this **SharePoint admin center** tab in your Edge browser. Leave the other tabs open in your browser for the next task.

> **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:

<validation step="8c9fc7ff-176c-47b4-9729-0df4c4ad6dde" />


### Task 4 – Turn on Audit Logging to enable Alert Policies 

1. In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, under the **Admin centers** section in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Security**. This will open the **Microsoft 365 Defender** portal in a new tab in your browser.

1. In the **Microsoft 365 Defender** portal, scroll down towards the bottom of the left-hand navigation pane and select **Audit (1)**.

1. In the **Audit** window, wait a minute or so to see if a banner appears towards the top of the page that says: **Start recording user and admin activity (2)**. If this banner appears, then auditing is NOT turned on for your organization. This banner is your prompt to turn on audit logging.

	>**Note:** Select this banner now to turn on audit logging, and on the **Security** pop-up select **Yes**, and if it says **We're updating your organization to support customization. Please allow 24 to 48 hours before you retry this operation.**, select **OK**.

    ![](../Images/auditsearch.png)

1. In the **Audit** window, the banner will disappear once audit logging is turned on. In a later lab, you will return to this page to view audited activities that you completed during your lab work.  
 
1. Close the **Microsoft 365 Defender** tab in your Edge browser. Leave your browser open and proceed to the next task. 


### Task 5 – Install Microsoft Graph PowerShell   

1. On LON-CL1, you must open an elevated instance of **Windows PowerShell**. Type **power** in the Search box that appears in the bottom left corner of the taskbar. In the list of search results, right-click on **Windows PowerShell** (do not select Windows PowerShell ISE) and select **Run as administrator** in the drop-down menu that appears. 

2. Maximize your PowerShell window. In **Windows PowerShell**, type the following command at the command prompt to install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module from the PowerShell Gallery and then press Enter:
	```powershell
    Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

3. You will be prompted to confirm whether you want to install the module from an untrusted repository (PSGallery). Enter **A** to select **[A] Yes to All** and then press Enter.  

    >**Note:** Your response will initiate the installation of all the Microsoft Graph sub-modules. Once all the installation messages (for each sub-module) have finished displaying, it will still take approximately 5 to 10 minutes to complete the Microsoft Graph PowerShell installation. During this time, the cursor will continue to blink below the untrusted repository message. This may be a good time to take a short break.

4. A command prompt will appear once Microsoft Graph PowerShell has been installed. Run the following command to see the complete list of sub-modules that were installed under the Microsoft.Graph primary module:  
	
	```powershell
    Get-InstalledModule Microsoft.Graph.* 
    ```

	>**Note:** The labs that use Microsoft Graph PowerShell in this course will use the following sub-modules: Microsoft.Graph.Identity.DirectoryManagement, Microsoft.Graph.Users, and Microsoft.Graph.Groups. To access the cmdlets for a sub-module, you must first import the sub-module. You can either import all 30+ sub-modules at one time using the "Import-Module Microsoft.Graph" command, or you can import each module that's needed to perform whatever function you're doing (for example, "Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Users" to perform user maintenance) at a particular point in time. For the purpose of this training, since the later lab exercises will only use three sub-modules, you will NOT import all 40+ sub-modules now. Instead, you will wait to import these three sub-modules when they're needed in later labs. Proceed to the next step. 

5. PowerShell's execution policy settings dictate what PowerShell scripts can be run on a Windows system. Setting this policy to **Unrestricted** enables Holly to load all configuration files and run all scripts. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:
	
	```powershell
	Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted
	```
6. If you are prompted to verify that you want to change the execution policy, enter **A** to select **[A] Yes to All.** 

6. Do **NOT** close your PowerShell window. Leave the Windows PowerShell window open but minimize it for now. Remain logged into LON-CL1 and keep your Edge browser open.
