# Learning Path 6 - Lab 6 - Exercise 6 - Conduct a Drive-by URL attack using Attack Simulation training

## Lab scenario

Holly Dickson is concerned that some of the users at Adatum may require training about avoiding URL links to familiar websites that are either fake or have been hacked. This type of attack is known as a Drive-by URL attack. With this type of attack, a target receives an email containing a URL link, and when the target selects the link, they are taken to a website that runs background code whose sole purpose is to gather information about the target or deploy arbitrary code to their device. As part of her pilot project, Holly has decided to use the Microsoft 365 Attack simulation training feature to determine her users' susceptibility to Drive-by URL attacks.

>**Note:** At the end of this exercise, you will disable MFA for Holly's account. This will save you from having to enter the second form of authentication when signing in as Holly in any of the remaining labs in this course.


### Task 1: Configure and launch a Drive-by URL attack 

1. On LON-CL1, in your Edge browser, you should still be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Holly Dickson**. 

2. After the previous lab exercise, you should still be in the **Microsoft 365 Defender** portal. If not, then in the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, under the **Admin centers** group in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Security**.

3. In the **Microsoft 365 Defender** portal, you should still be on the **Attack simulation training** page; if not, then in the left-hand navigation pane, under **Email & collaboration**, select **Attack simulation training**.

### Task 2: Review the Drive-by URL attack results

1. Switch to **LON-CL2**, by navigating back to the hyper-v manager, and connect to **LON-CL2** VM.

1. On LON-CL2, in the Edge browser, you should have a tab open containing Lynne Robbins' Outlook mailbox from the prior lab exercise. In Lynne's Outlook Inbox, you should see the email that was sent by the Attack Simulator that's from **klemens@tailspintoys.com**. The subject of the email is **Free toy giveaway promotion from Tailspin Toys**. Select the email to open it and review the details in the body of the message. 

	>**NOTE:** It can take up to 15 minutes for the email to arrive.  Wait for the email before proceeding.

1. Select the link that is included in the email. Even though you know this is a Drive-by URL attack, this will enable you to see the effect of doing so in the Attack Simulator report that tracks the results of the spear phishing campaign. Selecting this link displays a web page that explains how you have been redirected to it as part of a Phishing awareness test being run by your organization.  Read through the contents of this site, which uses the landing page template that you selected in the prior task when setting up the attack simulation. 

1. In the **Outlook** tab in your Edge browser, select the picture of Lynne Robbins in the upper-right corner of the window. In Lynne's profile window that appears, select **Sign out**.

1. Once Lynne is signed out, close the Edge browser.

1. Switch back to **LON-CL1**.

1. On LON-CL1, in your browser session where you are logged in as Holly Dickson, you should still be on the **Attack simulation training** page. If the **Custom payload** simulation does not appear in the **Recent Simulations** list, select the **Refresh** icon to the left of the URL on the address bar. The **Custom payload** simulation should now appear. Select the **Custom payload** simulation to view the diagnostic results that were captured for this simulation.

	![](../Images/L6E6T2S7-3004.png)

1. A **Custom payload** page should appear. Review all the information collected for this simulated attack. When you're finished, select the **X** in the upper right-hand corner of the window to close it. 

	![](../Images/L6E6T2S8-3004.png)

1. Leave your browser open in LON-CL1 and do not close any of the tabs.


### Task 3: Disable Multi-factor Authentication for the Global Admin

1. On LON-CL1, in your Edge browser, you should still be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Holly Dickson**. 

1. To disable MFA for Holly Dickson's user account, you must first access the **Active users** list in the Microsoft 365 admin center. If you have the **Microsoft 365 admin center** open in a browser tab, then select that now; otherwise, open a new browser tab, enter **https://portal.office.com** in the address bar, and then on the **Office 365 home** page, select the **Admin** icon that appears in the column of app icons on the left-side of the screen. This opens the **Microsoft 365 admin center** in a new browser tab. 

1. On the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Users** and then select **Active users**.

1. In the **Active users** window, on the menu bar at the top of the user list, select **Multi-factor authentication**.

1. In the **multi-factor authentication** window (may need to select **Legacy per-user MFA**), the **users** tab is displayed by default. Select the **View (1)** drop-down, select **Global administrators (2)** and then **Apply (3)**. Select the check box for **Holly Dickson**, and in Holly's properties pane on the right, select **Disable MFA**.

	![](../Images/L6E6T3S5-3004.png)

	![](../Images/L6E6T3S5.1-3004.png)

1. On the **Disable multifactor authentication** dialog box, select **Disable**. 

1. When the **Updates successful** dialog box appears, select **close**. In the **multi-factor authentication** window, verify Holly's MFA Status has changed to **Disabled**. Close the **Multi-factor authentication** tab in your browser.

1. You must now sign out of Microsoft 365 as Holly and then sign back in as Holly (without MFA). To do so, perform the following steps: 

	- Select Holly's account icon (HD in a circle) at the top-right of the screen and in Holly's profile window, select **Sign out**.
	- Once you're signed out, close your Edge browser. Doing so will clear your cache.
	- Open a new Edge browser session.
	- Enter the **https://portal.office.com** URL.
	- In the **Pick an account** window, select Holly's account and enter the password.
	- From the **Microsoft Office Home** page, select the **Admin** icon to navigate to the **Microsoft 365 admin center**.
	
You are now ready to proceed to the next lab exercise.
