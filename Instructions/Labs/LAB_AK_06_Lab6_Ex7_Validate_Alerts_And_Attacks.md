# Learning Path 6 - Lab 6 - Exercise 7 - Validate Alert Nofications and Attack Simulation training

This lab included three exercises in which you configured Microsoft 365 to create alert notifications (Exercises 2 through 4). It also included two exercises that created Attack Simulation scenarios (Exercises 5 and 6). All five exercises generated an email notification, which must be received to validate whether the exercise completed successfully. For each of the five exercises, it could take up to 15 minutes for the system to create the corresponding email. Rather than having you wait up to 15 minutes to receive the email at the end of each exercise, (which is 75 total minutes of wait time; 5 exercises x 15 minutes each), the validation tasks for all five exercises have been moved to this final exercise in Lab 6. By the time you get to this final exercise, hopefully all emails for these five exercises have been generated and you will not have to endure any wait time.


### Task 1 – Validate the Mailbox Permission Alert

In Lab 6, Exercise 2, you configured an alert designed to notify Lynne Robbins when FullAccess permissions are granted to any mailbox within Adatum. You tested this alert by changing the FullAccess permission on Alex Wilber’s mailbox by granting Joni Sherman FullAccess to his mailbox. This activity should have triggered the alert policy that you created, which should have sent an alert notification email to Lynne Robbins’ mailbox. In this task, you will log into LON-CL2 as Lynne Robbins and see if she received this email. 

1. ‎Switch to **LON-CL2**. On **LON-CL2**, you should be signed into the machine as the local **administrator** (lon-cl2\admin) account. Select the **Microsoft Edge** icon in the taskbar, maximize the window (if necessary), and then enter the following URL in the address bar: **https://outlook.office365.com**

2. In the **Pick an account** window, if Lynne Robbins account (**LynneR@xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com**) appears in the user list, then select it now; otherwise, select **Use another account** and sign in as **LynneR@xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where xxxxxZZZZZZ is the tenant prefix provided by your lab hosting provider). Then enter the same **Microsoft 365 Tenant Password** provided by your lab hosting provider for the tenant admin account (i.e. the MOD Administrator account) as Lynne's password.

3. Lynne Robbins’ **Inbox** should include an email from the Alerts notification system (**Office365Alerts@microsoft.com**) to let her know that Holly Dickson has made a Mailbox permission change. <br/>

	**WARNING:** Lab testing has shown that in some cases, it can take up to 15 minutes or so for the email to be received in Lynne's Inbox. You may need to refresh Outlook one or more times until you receive the email.

4. Once the notification email arrives in Lynne's Inbox, open the email and review the contents. Scroll to the bottom of the email and select the **View alert details** button. This opens the **Microsoft Defender** portal in a new tab.

5. The **Microsoft Defender** portal displays the **Alerts** window, and it automatically opens the **Mailbox permission change** pane for this alert activity that triggered the email notification to Lynne. <br/>

	Scroll down through the **Mailbox permission change** pane and review all the information for this activity. When you are done, select **Close** to close the pane.

6. In your Edge browser, close the **View Alerts - Microsoft 365 security** tab. Leave Lynne's **Outlook** tab open, as you will use that in the next task.

You have just successfully tested a mailbox permission alert that sent an alarm message on granting FullAccess to a user mailbox.


### Task 2 – Validate the  SharePoint Permissions Alert

In Lab 6, Exercise 3, you configured an alert designed to notify Lynne Robbins when a user is added as a site collection administrator for a site collection. To test this alert, you added Alex Wilber as a site collection admin to the global SharePoint Communication site. This activity should have triggered the alert policy that you created, which should have sent an alert notification email to Lynne Robbins’ mailbox. In this task, you will validate whether Lynne received this alert notification email.

1. On **LON-CL2**, you should still be logged into **Outlook on the web** as **Lynne Robbins** from the prior task. Monitor Lynne's Inbox to view the email generated by the alert that you just created. 

2. Once the email arrives in Lynne's Inbox, open the email and review the contents. Scroll to the bottom of the email and select the **View alert details** button. This opens the **Microsoft Defender** portal in a new tab.

3. The **Microsoft Defender** portal displays the **Alerts** window, and it automatically opens the **Site collection admin permissions** pane for this alert activity that triggered the email notification to Lynne. <br/>

	Scroll down through the **Site collection admin permissions** pane and review all the information for this alert activity. When you are done, select **Close** to close the pane.

4. Leave your LON-CL1 and LON-CL2 VMs open for the remaining exercise in this lab.

You have now successfully tested the SharePoint alert to monitor site collection admin permissions on SharePoint sites. 


### Task 3 – Validate the default eDiscovery Alert

In Lab 6, Exercise 4, you created a default Microsoft 365 alert policy that notifies all tenant administrators, such as Holly Dickson, whenever an eDiscovery search has been created or exported. You also tested this alert by creating an eDiscovery search. This activity should have triggered the alert policy, which should have sent an alert notification email to all Tenant Admins. Holly is a Global admin, who by default are members of the Tenant Admin group; therefore, she should have received the email notification generated by this alert. In this task, you will validate whether Holly received the alert notification email.

1. On LON-CL1, in your Edge browser, you should still be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Holly Dickson**. 

2. In your **Microsoft Edge** browser, select the **Microsoft 365 admin center** tab. 
	
3. To test this alert, select the **Outlook** tab in your Edge browser. This should still be displaying Holly's mailbox. If you previously closed Outlook, then in the **Home | Microsoft 365** tab, in the column of application icons, select **Outlook**.

4. In Holly's Outlook mailbox, monitor her Inbox for an **Informational-severity alert: eDiscovery search started or exported** email that was automatically sent by the Alerts notification system. The purpose of this message is to inform Holly that an eDiscovery search was created or exported. If necessary, select the **Refresh** icon to the left of the URL address. Once the email is received, open it and review the contents, then close the message. <br/>

	**Note:** It may take up to 10 minutes or so before the email arrives in Holly's Inbox.

5. In your **Edge** browser, switch back to the **Microsoft Purview** portal (the **Content search - Microsoft Purview** tab) and under the **Solutions** group in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Audit**. 

6. Select the **Search** button to display all recent activity. This will display the activity that created this alert. If an **Add more filters to your search?** dialog box appears, select **Start search**. <br/>

	**Note:** It may take up to 24 hours for the search results to be displayed. If search results do not appear immediately, check again later in the day. If there are still no results, wait until the following day before checking again.

	**Note:** In the list of search results, note how the **User** for the prior alerts is listed as Holly, while the user for the eDiscovery alert is listed as **Service Account**. This is because the eDiscovery alert is a default system alert rather than a custom alert created by an individual user.

7. In your browser, leave the Outlook tab (**Mail - Holly Dickson - Outlook**) open as you will use it in the next task. Leave all your other browser tabs open as well.

You have now successfully tested the Microsoft 365 eDiscovery system alert that monitors the creation of an eDiscovery search or the export of data from a completed search.


### Task 4: Review the attack simulation results

In Lab 6, Exercise 5, you configured and launched a spear phishing attack, which should have sent a very intriguing, real-world looking email to all Adatum users. In this task, you will review the diagnostic feedback associated with the Spear Phishing attack that you simulated, and you will validate whether Lynne Robbins received the email.

1. Switch to **LON-CL2**, where you should be logged into the machine as the local **adatum\administrator** account.

2. On LON-CL2, open your Edge browser and enter the following URL in the address bar: **https://outlook.office365.com**.
 
3. In the **Pick an account** window, select **Use another account**. 

4. In the **Sign in** window, enter **LynneR@xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where xxxxxZZZZZZ is the tenant prefix ID provided by your lab hosting provider), and then in the **Enter password** window, enter the same Microsoft 365 Tenant Password provided by your lab hosting provider for the tenant admin account (i.e. the MOD Administrator account) and select **Sign in**. 

5. In Lynne's Outlook Inbox, you should see the spear phishing email that was sent by the Attack Simulator. The subject of the message should be **2 Failed messages to you**. Select the email to open it and review the details in the body of the message. 

	**NOTE!** It can take up to 15 minutes for the email to arrive.  Wait for the email before proceeding.

6. Select the **View Returned Messages** button in the email. Even though you know this is a spear phishing attack, this will enable you to see the effect of doing so in the Attack Simulator report that tracks the results of the spear phishing campaign.

7. In the **Sign in** dialog box that appears, enter **LynneR@xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where xxxxxZZZZZZ is the tenant prefix ID provided by your lab hosting provider), and then enter the same Microsoft 365 Tenant Password provided by your lab hosting provider for the tenant admin account (i.e. the MOD Administrator account) in the **Enter password** window. Select **Sign in**. 

8. This displays a web page that explains how you have been redirected to it as part of a Phishing awareness test being run by your organization. Read through the contents of this site, which uses the landing page template that you selected in the prior task when setting up the attack simulation.

9. Leave the Outlook tab open for Lynne's mailbox in your Edge browser. Do **NOT** sign out or close it. You will access Lynne's mailbox on LON-CL2 in the next lab exercise. 

10. Switch back to **LON-CL1**.

11. In LON-CL1, in your Edge browser session where you are logged in as Holly Dickson, you should still be on the **Attack simulation training** page. If the **PhishingTest1** simulation does not appear in the **Recent Simulations** list, select the **Refresh** icon to the left of the URL on the address bar. The **PhishingTest1** simulation should now appear. Select the **PhishingTest1** simulation to view the diagnostic results that were captured for this simulation.

12. A **PhishingTest1** page should appear. Review all the information collected for this simulated attack. When you're finished, select the **X** in the upper right-hand corner of the window to close it. 

13. Leave your browser open in LON-CL1 and do not close any of the tabs.
    

### Task 5: Review the Drive-by URL attack results

In Lab 6, Exercise 6, you ********* You will now review the results of the Drive-by URL simulation attack that you just launched. In this task, you will verify whether your organization has received the email that you configured in the Attack simulation training. You will then review the results associated with the Drive-by URL attack that you simulated.

1. Switch to **LON-CL2**.

2. On LON-CL2, in the Edge browser, you should have a tab open containing Lynne Robbins' Outlook mailbox from the prior lab exercise. In Lynne's Outlook Inbox, you should see the email that was sent by the Attack Simulator that's from **klemens@tailspintoys.com**. The subject of the email is **Free toy giveaway promotion from Tailspin Toys**. Select the email to open it and review the details in the body of the message. 

	**NOTE:** It can take up to 15 minutes for the email to arrive.  Wait for the email before proceeding.

8. Select the link that is included in the email. Even though you know this is a Drive-by URL attack, this will enable you to see the effect of doing so in the Attack Simulator report that tracks the results of the spear phishing campaign. <br/>

	Selecting this link displays a web page that explains how you have been redirected to it as part of a Phishing awareness test being run by your organization.  Read through the contents of this site, which uses the landing page template that you selected in the prior task when setting up the attack simulation. 

11. In the **Outlook** tab in your Edge browser, select the picture of Lynne Robbins in the upper-right corner of the window. In Lynne's profile window that appears, select **Sign out**.

12. Once Lynne is signed out, close the Edge browser.

13. Switch back to **LON-CL1**.

14. On LON-CL1, in your browser session where you are logged in as Holly Dickson, you should still be on the **Attack simulation training** page. If the **Custom payload** simulation does not appear in the **Recent Simulations** list, select the **Refresh** icon to the left of the URL on the address bar. The **Custom payload** simulation should now appear. Select the **Custom payload** simulation to view the diagnostic results that were captured for this simulation.

15. A **Custom payload** page should appear. Review all the information collected for this simulated attack. When you're finished, select the **X** in the upper right-hand corner of the window to close it. 

16. Leave your browser open in LON-CL1 and do not close any of the tabs.
